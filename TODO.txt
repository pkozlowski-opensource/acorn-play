- convert parser tests to Jasmine
  - finish conversion of the remaining parser tests
  - make sure that I've got a matcher that produces readable failrues
- AST transform  to take care of JshElementStart / JshElementEnd / JshElement nodes
  - change template function signature?
  - how to add imports?
  - add meaning to elements / components and their attributes (or do this in the initial template pass)    
  - actual tag node -> JS node transformation
  - how to generate consts (outside of a scope of a function, somewhere near top level?)
- switch to Jasmine or beef-up test runner (progress, color output)
- error-cases tests for parser
