- make sure that I've got a Jasmine matcher that produces readable parser failures
- AST transforms  
  - add meaning to elements / components and their attributes (or do this in the initial template pass)    
- code generation
  - take care of JshElementStart / JshElementEnd / JshElement nodes    
  - static attributes
    - how to generate consts (outside of a scope of a function, somewhere near top level?)
  - attr bindings
  - prop bindings
  - listeners  
- convert remaining parser tests to Jasmine  
- error-cases tests for parser
- move project to TS?
